# Hash-Function-and-Collision-Optimization
This paper seeks to investigate the efficiencies of hash tables influenced by varying
parameters with a focus on collision handling methods. An investigation was carried forward by
reason that, despite a hash table’s profound efficiency in terms of data structures for data search
and mapping, it is evident that inappropriate conditions such as a poorly chosen collision
handling method, hash function, or load factor for varying extents of weighted data distributions
would greatly affect a hash table’s performance. Subsequently, a conduction of a Python 3
program ran several trials to evaluate the insertion and retrieval of hash tables, adjusted based on
nine degrees of weighted data distribution, four varied collision handling methods, two hash
functions, at six different load factors. Data was experimentally retrieved by programming these
differently implemented hash tables and graphically analyzed. Consequently, no collision
handling method was evaluated to be the best in general, as each possessed their own flaws
under certain parameters while other methods could excel. Hence, the data would give insight to
optimizing the potential of a hash table’s efficiency when correctly implemented under these
known conditions.
